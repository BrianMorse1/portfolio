# week-2-challenge

## Project Description

This site is designed to act as an up-to-date portfolio of Brian Morse's work in application development and various other types of coding. If you are reading this, thank you for coming and feel free to look through the available examples of my work. 




### Considerations

This site is in development. Placeholder images are used as well as placeholder text. The framework for what will be a proffessional portfolio is there but there will be many changes. The color scheme is not settled, for instance. Additionally, the links on the photographs lead to google.com instead of a seperate page which will eventually contain samples of other projects I've created. Additionally, forms will be added for providing feedback on projects to help me grow my skillset.
